# Open-AI API Swagger

This yaml definition of Open-AI API comes from
 [OpenAPI spec for the OpenAI API](https://github.com/openai/openai-openapi),
 from [OpenAI official spec](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference)

The swagger.yml file is then processed to generate the Swagger-API documentation
https://pifou25.github.io/openai-api/

_(processed thanks to [Peter Evans tool](https://github.com/peter-evans/swagger-github-pages)
using [Swagger UI](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) 
and hosted by github pages)_
